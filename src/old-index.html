  <!-- <my-mood mood="great">
    <the-description>This example uses the "my-mood" component. By simply referencing the prop and adding a custom value, you will always get a consistent return using simple HTML.</the-description>
  </my-mood>

  <mood-adv mood="SWEEEET">
      <span slot="string">Today I am feeling pretty</span>
      <the-description slot="external">This example again gives you a similar UI experience, but allows for greater control over the string by allowing you to use the "slot" element and a custom property.
        <p>Something else to notice about this one is that the "mood-adv" component is extending the "my-mood" component. This means that it will inherit all the properties and CSS of "my-mood" but allow for customized use. </p>
      </the-description>
    </mood-adv>

  <my-paragraph>
    <span slot="internal">No CSS? That's cool ... it's all in the component!</span>
    <the-description slot="external">Want to create a custom paragraph style? Cool. Using this component versus a standard "p" tag, you will always get the same look without having to deal with any CSS.</the-description>
  </my-paragraph>


  <my-alert>
    <span slot="internal">Click me</span>
    <the-description slot="external">In this example, thing get pretty cool. This uses the slot option to place content inside a button element. Then the button element already comes with a custom internal event. By simply using HTML you get all the awesome with little to no effort.
      <p>Look in the console to see the result of the click.</p>

    <p>When looking at the code, there are a few other things to notice.</p>
